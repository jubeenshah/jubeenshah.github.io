title: "A Beautiful Mind and the Shared themes of Cinematic Artistry" 
---

This movie was released in 2001, but If i remember correctly, it was about in 2011-2014 that i would've watched it. I used to be very interested in movies like this when I was younger. I still am... just to say how much I have changed over the years. But over the years I've watched a lot of movies... So i've grown to link them up and look at how they're the same rather than how they're different.

The art of filmmaking is rich and multifaceted, incorporating a plethora of themes, narratives, and artistic approaches that resonate with diverse audiences. A powerful example of this is Ron Howard's "A Beautiful Mind," which explores mental health, resilience, and love. However, the power of cinema is seen not only in individual films but also in the shared themes and motifs across different movies, [tools that can transcend culture and language](https://youtu.be/he3x5flTFPg?si=bhGUS2V7F_9nX7iF). 

Obviously, looking at movies with a critical eye, is increasingly becoming a way of making sure it is relayed to the audience that the writer/narrator is not just a consumer but also a critic.... but that's not the point of this post. I liked the movie... and I liked the themes in the movie, and I liked the themes in other movies that I've watched that are similar to this movie, so I'm going to write about it. This is my way of self-expression, and you're going to have your own way of expressing yourself... and that's okay.

Movies like "A Beautiful Mind" and Memento depict protagonists grappling with the reliability of their mind, challenging the audience's perception of reality. Just as John Nash in "A Beautiful Mind" navigates his schizophrenia, Leonard in "Memento," played by Guy Pearce, struggles with anterograde amnesia, piecing together fragments of his past through a unique narrative structure that mirrors his memory loss.

The exploration of reality versus illusion is also a poignant theme in Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan. Natalie Portman's character battles not just her physical limits but also her psychological stability, reminiscent of Nash's struggle in "A Beautiful Mind." In both films, the protagonists' internal conflicts are externalized through the visual and narrative elements, blurring the lines between reality and perception. Maybe, very similar to how we perceive the world around us. _What does matter? What doesn't? What is real? What isn't?_

Human resilience in the face of adversity, a theme powerfully depicted in "A Beautiful Mind," is also reflected in films like [The Pianist](/hobby/2023/04/22/the-pianist.html). Adrien Brody's character's survival and resilience amid the horrors of the Holocaust echo the determination John Nash shows in managing his schizophrenia. Similarly, the Dead Poets' Society conveys this theme through its young characters challenging the restrictive norms of their boarding school.

The power of love, as seen in Nash's relationship with Alicia in "A Beautiful Mind," is also beautifully depicted in Call Me By Your Name. Despite the distinct narrative contexts, these films emphasize love's transformative potential, encapsulating its joy, heartbreak, and influence on personal growth. 

Rewatching the movie, and finding Paul Bettany in it, after watching him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, was a treat. Helps me visualize the growth of a person in the industry, and how they've been able to adapt to different roles.

The cultural exploration shown in Gulal and the battle of wits and strategy in Tetris share with "A Beautiful Mind" the exploration of human experience in their unique contexts, displaying the diversity and unity in cinematic storytelling. "Gulal," an Indian film directed by Anurag Kashyap, presents a starkly different cultural landscape compared to "A Beautiful Mind," yet it parallels in its exploration of human complexity and the struggle against societal norms. Set against the politically charged backdrop of a fictional Rajputana, "Gulal" delves into the dark underbelly of politics, power, and legitimacy. It presents a tapestry of characters driven by their ambition and identity, reminiscent of John Nash's struggle with his schizophrenia and his quest for recognition in his field. "Gulal" uses the cultural lens of an Indian royal lineage, not only to expose the harsh realities of power politics but also to examine the human condition, just as "A Beautiful Mind" does within the realm of academia and mental health.

On the other hand, "Tetris," based on the iconic video game, showcases a battle of wits and strategy within the high-stakes world of intellectual property and corporate intrigue. The film explores the tumultuous journey of Alexey Pajitnov, the game's creator, as he navigates the complexities of the gaming industry and the fight for the rights to his creation. Despite the vastly different context, there's a resonance with "A Beautiful Mind" in how both protagonists use their intellectual prowess to navigate their respective worlds. Nash's mathematical brilliance parallels Pajitnov's visionary game design; both face formidable challenges that test not just their genius but also their resilience and integrity. 

Thus, despite their unique contexts and cultural backgrounds, "Gulal" and "Tetris" share with "A Beautiful Mind" the exploration of the human experience. Each film underscores the common human struggle for identity, recognition, and autonomy, depicting characters who must navigate societal pressures and personal adversities. Whether it's the political landscape of Rajputana, the competitive realm of game design, or the academic world grappling with mental illness, these films underscore the universality of human experiences, displaying the diversity and unity inherent in cinematic storytelling.

"A Beautiful Mind" shares common themes with a range of films across different genres and styles. This reveals the power of cinema to explore the intricacies of human experience and its commonalities, transcending cultural and thematic boundaries. Through these shared motifs, cinema emerges not just as a form of entertainment, but also as a potent medium for empathy, understanding, and reflection.

What does this have to do with anything?

At some point, i thought while using the GPT... wouldn't it be great that I don't necessarily have to connect the dots, but just give it a list of movies that I've liked and something about each that i liked in them. Maybe it can help connect the dots for me... If this was particularly boring of an article.. well.. maybe it was. But getting it out there, for other such bots and people to read, and _learn_ might be worth something, someday.. or just prove a point of how riduculous it this all sounds, with the context of me.
