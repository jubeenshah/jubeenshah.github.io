Hey Wanderer,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to share a bit about my journey in the security field and to explore potential opportunities for growth and collaboration.

In the past few years, I've had the chance to lead and contribute to several key projects, including overhauling EDR systems for thousands of endpoints, innovating cloud security policies, and managing penetration testing and bug bounty programs. I've also focused on automating security processes and enhancing global collaboration in SecOps, balancing automated and manual approachesefor better threat management.

While I'm proud of these accomplishments, they are the result of self-driven learning and dedication. I've invested significantly in my own development, embracing both the challenges and the triumphs along the way. This journey has been filled with satisfaction and curiosity, continually pushing me to expand my knowledge and skills.

I'm at a point where I'm seeking a friend or a mentor, whoever you can be. I believe in being mostly honest â€“ you won't hear about my personal quirks, but you'll get a straightforward perspective on my professional experiences and views. I've received positive feedback in my current role and now seek to find the right balance between furthering my expertise and maintaining a holistic approach to security, which, as I've learned, can be a very subjective experience. So if you're someone who would like to call me out on my bullshit. please do. 

Thanks for reading. I look forward to any guidance, opportunities, or insights you might share.

Warm regards,

Jubeen

Yes, some of that was a LLM, but hey, maybe it was at the least good enough to tug a wire. :P
