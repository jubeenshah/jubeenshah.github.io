[#tryingharder](http://localhost:4000/education/certificates/2023/02/17/offsec-osda.html)Â each day. But Iâ€™ve got a soft side! andÂ [thatâ€™s okay](http://localhost:4000/personal/blog/2022/08/03/thats-okay.html). I completed myÂ [masters](http://localhost:4000/education/formal/2020/05/09/ncsu-mscs.html). Iâ€™m living in Raleigh, NC or could be â€˜tryingâ€™ to tunnel my way through to the network. Iâ€™m here on H1-B visa, mostly to learn. Iâ€™m around till 2027 legally (unless some business decides to sponsor me for a green card). Iâ€™ve not seen the future, but hoping for the best. :)

Last couple of years have been difficult. Iâ€™ve been learning a lot more than I could process. With the OffSecâ€™sÂ [OSDA](http://localhost:4000/education/certificates/2023/02/17/offsec-osda.htm), and all the prep work for OSWA (which I failed twice) and dealing with work and the fact that I'm away from my family and dog. I'm but, just a man!

I like day dreaming, adds some flavour. Otherwise, I like to work hard, or at least I havenâ€™t heard anyone complain! But, I have heard good things. ðŸ˜€

Did you have a look atÂ [cosmos?](http://localhost:4000/projects/iot/2017/11/02/00-cosmos.html), it was aÂ [bachelor](http://localhost:4000/education/formal/2018/08/17/mpstme-btech-it.html)Â project, but i worked on it like it was a company. huh! Some mistakes were made, and some memories let fade. But the learningsâ€¦EPIC! A little old. But a good starting point.

I don't like to blog a lot. But I did like [writing](https://www.instagram.com/j.s_quotes/) at one point and enjoy its creative process. I don't create a lot of beautiful looking work. But when I do, i feel like the work has to be beautiful, and fortunately that takes up a lot of time. 


While studying for the OSWA, and in general studying for OffSec, i started taking a lot of notes. and that helped me study, and while doing that I also reflected on the world of security and its features and bugs.

I've been pretty disorganized, and I've got a lot of variables to blame. But only one constant to say "Job, well done!" I try to be thankful and friendly. But sometimes, I just forget. I'm sorry.
