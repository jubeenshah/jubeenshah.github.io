## me

[#tryingharder](/education/certificates/2023/02/17/offsec-osda.html) each day. But I've got a soft side! and [that's okay](/personal/blog/2022/08/03/thats-okay.html). I completed my [masters](/education/formal/2020/05/09/ncsu-mscs.html). I'm living in Raleigh, NC or could be 'trying' to tunnel my way through to the network. I'm here on H1-B visa, mostly to learn. I'm around till 2027 legally (unless some business decides to sponsor me for a green card). I've not seen the future, but hoping for the best. :)

Did you have a look at [cosmos?](/projects/iot/2017/11/02/00-cosmos.html), it was a school project, but i worked on it like it was a company. huh! Some mistakes were made, and some memories let fade. But the learnings...EPIC! A little old. But a good starting point.
