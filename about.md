I completed my [masters](/education/formal/2020/05/09/ncsu-mscs.html). I'm living in Raleigh, NC or could be 'trying' to tunnel my way through to the network. I'm here on H1-B visa, mostly to learn. I'm around till 2027 legally (unless some business decides to sponsor me for a green card). I've not seen the future, but hoping for the best. :)

Last couple of years have been difficult. I've been learning a lot more than I could process. With the OffSec's [OSDA](/education/certificates/2023/02/17/offsec-osda.htm), and all the prep work for OSWA (which I failed twice) and dealing with work and the fact that

Did you have a look at [cosmos?](/projects/iot/2017/11/02/00-cosmos.html), it was a [bachelor](/education/formal/2018/08/17/mpstme-btech-it.html) project, but i worked on it like it was a company. huh! Some mistakes were made, and some memories let fade. But the learnings...EPIC! A little old. But a good starting point or my latest post.

Also, know my way around [splunk](/education/certificates/11/01/splunk-core-certified-power-user.html), can create interactive dashboards, use it for quick look at the data. With [AWS](/certificates/2020/02/14/aws-csa.html), I think I'm comfortable finding things and [understanding](/education/certificates/2021/10/08/redhat-rhce.html) what things should be investigated when things go wrong, but need to get better at IaC.
