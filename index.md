[#tryingharder](/education/certificates/2023/02/17/offsec-osda.html) each day to be a little more thoughtful, and a little more vigilant, while finding a balance and helping out. 

Looking for a mentor to help me. So if you can help, please do! :) [Link](/personal/blog/2023/11/12/looking-for-mentor.html)
