Projects
========

### Security

Security and Privacy have always been very close topics to me. I started my journey with security in 2016 with a semester abroad to study the field. 

But I reckon, it started at a young age, when i started tinkering with dismantling my Nokia N8, to see what the insides look like. :P 

[see projects](./projects/01-security.html)

I completed my masters in computer science at NC State University with a security specialization and working for LexisNexis since July 2020. 

### DevOps

I was introduced to DevOps through a course at NC State University back in 2019. since then, I've worked on a few projects that try to incorporate the power of continuous delivery pipeline into a seamless process of build, test, and deployment. 
  
I'm continually working on improving my skills and learning new ones to integrate DevOps with other domains (like security).

### Internet of Things


IoT holds a special place in my heart because of its potential to make the world a better place, and because I've worked on projects ([cosmos](./_posts/2017-11-02-00-cosmos.html)) that have taught me a lot. Not only in terms of skills but also in terms of capabilities. My long-term goal is to blend my skills in security, privacy, and DevOps with IoT to help build a better, secure, and private world.

You'll see a list of posts below. It should at least be presentable. Some links might not work. But hoping to get those fixed soon.
