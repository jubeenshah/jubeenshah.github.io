## Cosmos
The idea of Cosmos, in brief, was to make affordable custom IoT endpoints that can be managed via multiple interfaces. Few examples of the managed endpoints that were designed are intrusion sensors, fire sensors, connected LED lights, connected switches and switchboards, and connected locks. A monitoring dashboard was also developed for better interpretation of the data collected.
