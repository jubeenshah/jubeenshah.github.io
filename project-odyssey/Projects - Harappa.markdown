## Harappa

Design and architecture of a system is equally important for a successful implementation of an idea. This project is a precursor of Project Cosmos, in which the entire system was envisioned from an architect point of view. The project tries to reason with the assumptions that were made in Project Cosmos, and also criticizes certain approaches and how it could've been better.
