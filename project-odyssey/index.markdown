about
=====

I believe each of us has the potential to do good things that inspires lives; with my work, I believe I can do much more. I have a clear goal for myself - to be successful in the evolving field of Technology, which utilizes my innate and acquired skills and allows me room for self-expression and creativity. Skill development, as compared to opportunity, demands a self-driven approach, and I’ve had a focused quest towards it.

### DevOps

![Dashboard image from DevOps Project named Poseidon](https://project-odyssey.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/22d27973b298ca363a72590a46d26d65.png)

![](https://project-odyssey.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/9e27bf0382944aa66e5e702bc04bfb2b.png)

I was introduced to DevOps through a course at NC State University back in 2019. since then, I've worked on a few projects that try to incorporate the power of continuous delivery pipeline into a seamless process of build, test, and deployment. in fact, I update this very website (project [odyssey](projects/devops/odyssey.html)) regularly using DevOps.  
  
I'm continually working on improving my skills and learning new ones to integrate DevOps with other domains (like security).

[see projects](projects/devops.html)

### Security

Security and Privacy have always been very close topics to me. I started my journey with security in 2016 with a semester at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel. I achieved my masters in computer science at NC State University with a security specialization and will be joining LexisNexis as a security engineer in july. I am also working towards nourishing my skills in the privacy domain.

[see projects](projects/security.html)

### Internet of Things

IoT holds a special place in my heart because of its potential to make the world a better place, and because I've worked on projects ([cosmos](projects/iot/cosmos.html)) that have taught me a lot. Not only in terms of skills but also in terms of capabilities. My long-term goal is to blend my skills in security, privacy, and DevOps with IoT to help build a better, secure, and private world.
