What information do I collect?
==============================

In Short:   Some information — such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.  
  
I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser, and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use my Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of my Services, and for my internal analytics and reporting purposes.  
  
Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies.

How do I use your information?
==============================

**In Short**: I process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of my contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.  
‍  
I use personal information collected via our Services for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on my legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations. I indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each purpose listed below.We use the information we collect or receive:  
**  
To protect my Services**: I may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our Services safe and secure (for example, for security compromise and prevention).  
**  
For other Business Purposes**: I may use your information for other Business Purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve my Services, products, marketing, and your experience. I may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end-users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.  

Will you information be shared with anyone?
===========================================

**In Short**: I only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.  
  
I may process or share data based on the following legal basis:  
  
‍**Performance of a Contract**: Where I have entered into a contract with you, I may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.  
‍  
‍**Legal Obligations**: I may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).  
‍  
‍**Vital Interests**: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.  

How long do I keep your information?
====================================

**In Short:**  I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.  
‍  
I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require me keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.  

How do I keep your information Safe?
====================================

**In Short:**  I aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.  
  
I have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that I cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.  

Do I collect information from minors?
=====================================

**In Short:**  I do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.  
  
I do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.  
  
If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact me at jnshah2 {a.t sign} ncsu {d.o.t} edu.

I may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If I make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes. I encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how I am protecting your information.  

Controls for Do Not Track features
==================================

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.  
  
As such, I do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.  

How can you contact me about this policy
========================================

If you have questions or comments about this policy, you may contact me, Jubeen Shah, by email at jnshah2 {a.t sign} ncsu {d.o.t}
