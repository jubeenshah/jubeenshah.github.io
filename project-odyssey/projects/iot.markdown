Cosmos
------

Abstract
--------

The idea of Cosmos, in brief, was to make affordable custom IoT endpoints that can be managed via multiple interfaces. Few examples of the managed endpoints that were designed are intrusion sensors, fire sensors, connected LED lights, connected switches and switchboards, and connected locks. A monitoring dashboard was also developed for better interpretation of the data collected.

Harappa
-------

Abstract
--------

Design and architecture of a system is equally important for a successful implementation of an idea. This project is a precursor of Project Cosmos, in which the entire system was envisioned from an architect point of view. The project tries to reason with the assumptions that were made in Project Cosmos, and also criticizes certain approaches and how it could've been better.
