Project Harappa
===============

Abstract
--------

Harappa is a design and architectural extension of the Cosmos. This project outlines the business and technical requirement of Cosmos. The elements of the IoT system architecture including the things, people, sensors, and actuators are taken into consideration while designing the system. Finally a detailed overview of the IoT-A architecture with related diagrams and feedback models are discussed to make the Cosmos a much more reliable implementation.

IDA Architecture
----------------

IDA architecture aims at providing comprehensive information about the project. The architecture has been divided into four layers depending on the functionality it pertains to the project. However, this architecture is devoid of technical details which is covered in the IoT-A architecture.

In the lowest layer Sensor Layer, we have the different types of sensors which are responsible for measuring various aspects of the house in which they would be deployed. These sensors would not only be responsible to monitor the environment but also, collect and process the data collected at the edge and process it before sending it over to AWS for processing and storage. These sensors would also be equipped with connectivity such as WiFi using ESP8266, and other micro-controllers to allow for communication with the local network and to the AWS servers via the internet.  
  
The next layer in the diagram is the Gateway and Networks. This layer is primarily responsible for the communication aspect of the project with the outside world, that is, AWS. The micro-controller in our project (ESP8266) would be the gateway that would be responsible for enabling the sensors to connect to the local WiFi network to allow for the transfer of information.  
  
The Management Service Layer provides the basis for access to the services that would be a core part of the project as provided by AWS. This mainly comprises of the services associated with Analytics, Machine Learning, Security, Data, and Alerts.  
  
Finally, the Application Layer covers the layer 5 application protocols that would be needed to achieve some of the business requirements stated for the project.

Why Harappa?
------------

For the name for the project, I wanted to choose something that has historical roots in the field of architecture. Harappa is an archeological site from the Indus Valley civilization that is famous for its architectural and cultural novelness. With this name, I wanted not only to associate the term architecture to the project, but also to highlight the lost city and its glory, which in many ways sculpted many civilizations that came after it.
