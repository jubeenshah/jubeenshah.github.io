            <h2 id="sensors" class="generic-project-heading-two iot">Sensors</h2>
            <div class="generic-project-paragraph-div">
              <p class="generic-project-paragraph-element project-content">This subsection lists and describes in some detail the sensors that would be needed as a part of the project. This is not an exhaustive list and more/fewer sensors might be needed as a part of the implementation when considering each house.</p>
            </div>
            <ul role="list" class="generic-project-list">
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Temperature &amp; Humidity — DHT22</span>: The temperature and humidity sensor would help record the temperature and humidity of the environment (room/house) with an accuracy unto ±2% for relative humidity and unto ±0.5°C (±0.9°F). The primary purpose of the DHT22 sensor is to send updates to the user and other things (actuators) in the environment to take appropriate action based on the readings from the sensor. For example, if the temperature shoots above a threshold value, an alert can be sent to the user that the air conditioner has been turned on, while concurrently sending a signal to the air conditioner to turn on. Similarly, in case of humidity readings, a dehumidifier can be turned on.<br></li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Air Pressure — BMP180</span>: Air Pressure Sensor can give relative height from the sea level, and this information along with the temperature reading either from BMP180 [6] sensor itself, or the DHT22 sensor, can help control the temperature of the environment more accurately in hilly regions to provide more energy efficiency. According to the datasheet, the BMP 180 sensor has an accuracy of ±0.12 hPa.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Light Sensor — BH1750</span>: Light Intensity sensor would help record the amount luminosity in the environment. This would then be translated into other signals for other actuators in the environment primarily the switches for lights and window blinds. It has a very high resolution that gives values ranging from 1 lux to 65535 lux.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Air Quality Sensor — MQ2</span>: The MQ2 sensor would record the concentration of different gases in the environment. The concentration of the gases is calculated on the basis of electrical conductivity. MQ2 Gas sensor has high sensitivity to LPG, Propane, and hydrogen, and also other combustible steam. When different gasses are present in the higher concentration, the conductivity of the sensor increase.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Motion Sensor — PIR</span>: The motion sensor is a Passive Infrared sensor that makes use of anomalies in IR generated to detect motion in the environment. This sensor would be able to detect motion, and then based on a certain set of predefined rules and conditions, ESP8266 would be used to send a signal other devices in the environment to generate an alarm. </li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">UV Sensor — ML8511</span>: ML8511 works on a similar principle such as FC-28. However, it is to be noted that both FC-28 and the ML8511 use the Analog pin to communicate with the micro-controller. What this means, is that only one of them would be able to communicate with the micro-controller at any one time since ESP8266 has only one Analog pin, a Demultiplexer such as the IC 4051 would be needed to switch between the Analog pins between two or more sensors using it.<br></li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Magnetic Sensor</span>: The switches would make use of the relays to switch on/off a device. The smart switches would simply make use of multiple relays to switch on/off a device like the irrigation system, the smart switches would be given three triggering mechanisms. The first would be an alert signal from any of the sensors in the environment which would trigger the switch being turned on/off, and the remaining two are discussed in the mobile app.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Camera</span>: The camera would be used to classify the type of plant as required in BR 15. It would make use of the AWS Rekognition service to classify the plant type</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Soil Moisture Sensor—FC28</span>: Soil Moisture sensor makes use of conductance between two electrodes, to determine the percentage amount of water in the soil. This sensor makes use of an Analog pinto detect the difference in voltage level, which can then be used to translate into digital data</li>

              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Micro-controller—ESP8266</span>: The ESP8266 would be the brains of the individual sensors that would have the compute capability to wirelessly transfer information to the cloud server. This would also have the power supply connected to it; either in the form of a battery or any other source of wall outlet (5V) </li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Valves</span>: The valves would be part of the irrigation system which would be used to control the flow of water to the plants.</li>

            <ul role="list" class="generic-project-list">
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Things to Data</span>: Rooms would be monitored for different data points including temperature, humidity, air pressure, the light intensity which would be collected by different sensors in the room. For example,, when the temperature sensor records some value from the room it would generate data that would then be sent to the AWS environment for further processing or storage.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Thing to Thing</span>: The mobile device is used to manage the states of the devices in the environment. For example, when the mobile device is used by the user of the system to manage the state of switches in the environment, the user would toggle the switch on the mobile device via the application which would then be sent to the AWS environment for processing. This would then trigger a Lambda function which would then cause the switch in the house of the user to change states.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Thing to People</span>: Notification being sent by the device to the user. For example, when the  alarm is triggered, it would send an MQTT message to the AWS environment which would then trigger a Lambda function to trigger the AWS SNS to send a notification to the user of the system on the mobile device associated with the automation environment.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Data to Things</span>: Trigger generated based on events from the database to control the states of things in the environment. For example, soil moisture reading, triggering the activation of the water sprinklers. </li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Data to People</span>: Visualization of the past information of the data being stored in the database. The data being collected by the sensors, when sent to the AWS environment would trigger several Lambda functions, one of which would be responsible for the visualization of the data being collected for the user of the system to understand. </li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">Data to Data</span>: When data is used to extract data from other databases. for example, when we use the flower name from the classification model to get the water requirements from another database.</li>
              <li class="generic-project-list-items"><span class="bold-point">People to Data</span>: People manually changing the status of a particular device in the environment. For example, when the user is using the mobile device to manage the state of a particular device in the environment, the user is also adding data points for the states of the devices that he is managing.<br></li>
