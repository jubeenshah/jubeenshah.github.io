### Heading

### Heading

Abstract
--------

This project covers the security vulnerability testing that was performed on the OpenMRS - an open source healthcare system using static and dynamic analysis tools. The project was divided into three stages to understand the different aspects of security testing of an open source application, and contribute patches to it.

Abstract
--------

In this project, privacy implications of smart wearable devices was studied. The primary goal of this project was to identify what are the privacy concerns of users, how they perceived data collection, and what is their level of awareness with regards to the data usage and privacy policies of smart wearable devices.

### Heading

Abstract
--------

This project covers the build, test, and deployment of pre-developed projects (NodeJS and Java) into a cloud environment using configuration management tools, and build tools. Measures were taken to make the project resilient to node failures. As part of the final milestone, monitoring and analysis component was developed and integrated using to monitor different metrics from each node.

Abstract
--------

What you have been experiencing so far with this website is a result of Project Odyssey. With this project I wanted to assimilate all that I've learnt through grad school including but not limtied to Security, DevOps, Privacy, and Software Engineering. This project is continually being developed and updated with more features and functionalities being added all the time

### Heading

### Heading

Abstract
--------

The idea of Cosmos, in brief, was to make affordable custom IoT endpoints that can be managed via multiple interfaces. Few examples of the managed endpoints that were designed are intrusion sensors, fire sensors, connected LED lights, connected switches and switchboards, and connected locks. A monitoring dashboard was also developed for better interpretation of the data collected.

### Heading

Abstract
--------

Design and architecture of a system is equally important for a successful implementation of an idea. This project is a precursor of Project Cosmos, in which the entire system was envisioned from an architect point of view. The project tries to reason with the assumptions that were made in Project Cosmos, and also criticizes certain approaches and how it could've been better.
