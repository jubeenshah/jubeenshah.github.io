Security and Privacy have always been very close topics to me. I started my journey with security in 2016 with a semester abroad to study the field. 

But I reckon, it started at a young age, when i started tinkering with dismantling my Nokia N8, to see what the insides look like. :P 

I completed my masters in computer science at NC State University with a security specialization and working for LexisNexis since July 2020.

Will not have much of my recent projects. But, hoping to add them soon. In the mean time, please explore these projects. 

If you have suggestions/ideas based on my past work, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jubeen-shah/). I promise, I will help with an [alternative](https://github.com/jubeenshah/jubeenshah.github.io/projects/1#card-91078405). 

## Medjay



This project covers the security vulnerability testing that was performed on the OpenMRS - an open source healthcare system using static and dynamic analysis tools. The project was divided into three stages as a university project to understand the different aspects of security testing of an open source application, and contribute patches to it.

## Oikos



In this project, privacy implications of smart wearable devices was studied. The primary goal of this project was to identify what are the privacy concerns of users, how they perceived data collection, and what is their level of awareness with regards to the data usage and privacy policies of smart wearable devices.
