I was introduced to DevOps through a course at NC State University back in 2019. since then, I've worked on a few projects that try to incorporate the power of continuous delivery pipeline into a seamless process of build, test, and deployment. 
  
I'm continually working on improving my skills and learning new ones to integrate DevOps with other domains (like security).

Poseidon
--------

This project covers the build, test, and deployment of pre-developed projects (NodeJS and Java) into a cloud environment using configuration management tools, and build tools. Measures were taken to make the project resilient to node failures. As part of the final milestone, monitoring and analysis component was developed and integrated using to monitor different metrics from each node.

Odyssey

What you have been experiencing so far with this website is a result of Project Odyssey. With this project I wanted to assimilate all that I've learnt through grad school including but not limtied to Security, DevOps, Privacy, and Software Engineering. This project is continually being developed and updated with more features and functionalities being added all the time
