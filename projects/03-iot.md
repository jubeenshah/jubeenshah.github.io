IoT holds a special place in my heart because of its potential to make the world a better place, and because I've worked on projects ([cosmos](./_posts/2017-11-02-00-cosmos.html)) that have taught me a lot. Not only in terms of skills but also in terms of capabilities. My long-term goal is to blend my skills in security, privacy, and DevOps with IoT to help build a better, secure, and private world.

You'll see a list of posts below. It should at least be presentable. Some links might not work. But hoping to get those fixed soon. 

## Cosmos


The idea of Cosmos, in brief, was to make affordable custom IoT endpoints that can be managed via multiple interfaces. Few examples of the managed endpoints that were designed are intrusion sensors, fire sensors, connected LED lights, connected switches and switchboards, and connected locks. A monitoring dashboard was also developed for better interpretation of the data collected.

## Harappa


Design and architecture of a system is equally important for a successful implementation of an idea. This project is a precursor of Project Cosmos, in which the entire system was envisioned from an architect point of view. The project tries to reason with the assumptions that were made in Project Cosmos, and also criticizes certain approaches and how it could've been better.
