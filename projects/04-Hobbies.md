I like other things as well, things that I like to do in my time. Songs, Movies, Games and Books, keep the human part of me alive, and curious for more. Getting lost in the realms of nothingness, and finding something that I can relate to, is what I like to do. These arts of expressions are a sum total of all the people who have worked on it, gotten inspired by other such artists, and have been able to create something that is unique and beautiful.

## Movies, TV Shows & Anime

I've not written much about movies, until recently. But Hopping that when the time and circumstances are right, I will be able to leave something behind that has helped me grow.

Since, this site was never really in the picture, when I wrote about the movies and how they made me feel, Here's a small list of movies that i've written something about, or just thought about while writing this page.

## Music

I like all kinds of music, from what I can gather. Rather, I would say that I'm open to all kinds of music... but maybe that's just a way of saying I don't really know what I like. I've not delved into the depths of the music to categorize the genre and other pieces that make music, music.

It's a journey.. and

So if you have the time, and energy to dig through the chaos that is - Jubeen...here it is.

## Games

You've got to experience everything, and one easy way from your couch is to play some good games. 

* [Ghost of Tsushima](https://youtu.be/d3DVKPytWig?si=GGeunq5FeXB3mngM&t=24)
* [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://youtu.be/ebZISyvVrnU?si=8-3gsVD-FKEJl7bp&t=224)
* Last of Us 1 & 2

I've not written much about games, but I've played a lot of them. It's an experience that I've not been able to put into words, but I'm sure I will be able to do that someday. Assassin's creed, Prince of Persia, Call of Duty, and many more. I like role-playing games, and games that have a good story.

## Books

Thousand words, and a thousand worlds. A book is a journey, and a journey is a book. If pictures are worth a thousand words, then a book is worth a thousand pictures. Funny how gpt thinks this is a good idea to phrase it. There are [far more books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155048921-jubeen-shah) that I've read, but here are a few to start with.
